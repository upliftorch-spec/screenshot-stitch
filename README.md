## 功能與執行 / Usage

核心功能在瀏覽器執行；資料查詢、地圖、字型或第三方函式庫可能仍需網路。

The browser frontend may require network access for public data, map tiles, fonts or third-party libraries.

使用任何靜態 HTTP server 提供此資料夾，例如：

```sh
npx --yes http-server . -p 8080 -c-1
```

Open `http://localhost:8080/` or `/en/` for English. Files are not sample customer uploads. This repository contains only the selected tool frontend and required local assets.

## Privacy / 隱私

- Removed advertising loaders, placements, ad account identifiers and tracking scripts.
- No personal identity, customer records, environment files, deployment credentials, account tokens or original Git history are included.
- Do not commit user-entered files, passwords, spreadsheet contents or credentials.
- External libraries, data providers and configured APIs can receive requests; local processing does not mean zero network activity.
- Public datasets are not bundled. Any existing public data-feed URLs remain dependencies, not a promise of continued availability or a license to redistribute the data.
